Raw materials:
Mo slug (99.95%), Lot #W12D050
Nb powder (99.99%), Lot #E21Y045
Ta powder (99.98%), Lot #22279

Procedure:
target masses
Mo: 0.1237 g, Nb: 0.1198 g, Ta: 0.4665 g

measured masses
Mo: 0.1235 g, Nb: 0.1199 g, Ta: 0.4642 g

initial mass: 0.7076 g
final mass: 0.7053 g
loss: 0.33%

Pressed both Nb and Ta powder into pellets: Had to cut both with bolt cutters to get the correct ratios

Heating curve: Pellets were heated, melted, and flipped 3 times each
