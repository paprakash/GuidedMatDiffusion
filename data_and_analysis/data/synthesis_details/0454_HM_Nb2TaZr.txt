Raw materials:
Nb powder (99.99%), Lot #E21Y045
Ta foil, unknown purity & Lot #
Zr sponge (99.5%), Lot #C19Y039

Procedure:
target masses
Nb: 0.2089 g, Ta: 0.2035 g, Zr: 0.1026 g

measured masses
Nb: 0.2087 g, Ta: 0.2043 g, Zr: 0.1022 g

initial mass: 0.5152 g
final mass: 0.514 g
loss: 0.23%

Nb was pressed into a pellet and arced beforehand. Ta was also arced beforehand.
Heating curve: once a pellet, melt was heated and flipped 3 times. heated for 30-40 seconds
