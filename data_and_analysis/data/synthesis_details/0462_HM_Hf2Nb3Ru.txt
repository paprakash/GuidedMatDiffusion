Raw materials:
Hf sponge(99.6%), Lot #WD14U011
Nb powder (99.99%), Lot #E21Y045
Ru pellets (99.95%), Lot #P07J007

Procedure:
target masses
Hf: 0.2103 g, Nb: 0.1642 g, Ru: 0.0595 g

measured masses
Hf: 0.2104 g, Nb: 0.1642 g, Ru: 0.0596 g

initial mass: 0.4342 g
final mass: 0.4287 g
loss: 1.27%

Pressed Nb powder into pellets and then arced the pellets before doing the synthesis

After first flip, when remelting, sparks/bits flew off and likely led to ~1% loss as opposed to samples 463 and 464 (which were made at the same time) which had very little loss

Heating curve: once a pellet, melt was heated and flipped 3 times. heated for 30 seconds
