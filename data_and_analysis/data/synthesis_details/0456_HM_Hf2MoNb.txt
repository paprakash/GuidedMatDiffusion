Raw materials:
Hf sponge (99.6%), Lot #WD14U011
Mo slug (99.95%), Lot #W12D050
Nb powder (99.99%), Lot #E21Y045

Procedure:
target masses
Hf: 0.3172 g, Mo: 0.0852 g, Nb: 0.0826 g

measured masses
Hf: 0.3173 g, Mo: 0.0853 g, Nb: 0.0825 g

initial mass: 0.4851 g
final mass: 0.4834 g
loss: 0.35%

Nb was pressed into a pellet and arced beforehand.
Heating curve: once a pellet, melt was heated and flipped 3 times. heated for 30-40 seconds
