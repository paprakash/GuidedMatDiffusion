Raw materials:
Mo slug (99.95%), Lot #W12D050
Nb powder (99.99%), Lot #E21Y045
Ru pellets (99.95%), Lot #P07J007

Procedure:
target masses
Mo: 0.1911 g, Nb: 0.0617 g, Ru: 0.1342 g

measured masses
Mo: 0.1910 g, Nb: 0.0616 g, Ru: 0.1343 g

initial mass: 0.3869 g
final mass: 0.3868 g
loss: 0.03%

Pressed Nb powder into pellets and then arced the pellets before doing the synthesis

Heating curve: once a pellet, melt was heated and flipped 3 times. heated for 30 seconds
